# **Course Overview**

**Humanitarians AI — Computational Finance with Agentic AI** is a community-driven, open-access educational project where volunteers—often recent graduates, students, and early-career technologists—**learn by teaching**.

This course is a **work in progress**, continually evolving through:

* Iterative outlines
* Community-created lecture content
* GitHub-hosted hands-on labs
* Real-time improvements using the **Humanitarians Courses GPT**

# **Course Structure & Pedagogy**

Humanitarians AI YouTube courses follow a **“Learn → Build → Teach”** cycle:

1. **Start with an Outline**
   Volunteers begin with a structured outline (like this one) and improve it collaboratively.

2. **Develop Hands-On Labs First**
   Before any lecture videos are produced, the course repository includes:

   * Jupyter notebooks
   * Python code demos
   * Data labs
   * Mini-projects
   * Applied financial analysis exercises

3. **Use the Humanitarians Courses GPT**
   Volunteers generate:

   * Lecture scripts
   * Slides
   * Lab guides
   * Assignments
   * Demos & analogies

4. **Produce YouTube Lectures**
   Only after the labs are complete do volunteers record:

   * Concept walkthroughs
   * Coding tutorials
   * Mini-lectures
   * Practitioner/guest interviews

5. **Continuous Updating**
   New fellows continually enhance the course with:

   * Updated labs
   * Agentic AI demonstrations
   * New datasets
   * Additional lecture videos

* Community finance forecasting

---

## **Module 9 — Capstone: Build Something That Helps Someone**

Each learner creates:

* A financial analysis agent
* A small valuation or forecasting tool
* An open dataset (curated market, ESG, or industry data)
* A tutorial or explainer
* A visualization or dashboard
* Or a social-good finance project

Capstones must align with **AI for Good** principles.
